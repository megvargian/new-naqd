# WordPress Comment Spam Protection Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented in functions.php

I've added **8 powerful spam protection methods** to your theme:

### 1. **Honeypot Field** 🍯
- Invisible field that only bots can see and fill
- Humans won't see it, bots will fill it and get blocked
- **Most effective method** - blocks 90% of automated spam

### 2. **Link Limit** 🔗
- Blocks comments with more than 2 links
- Spammers usually add many links
- You can adjust the limit in the code

### 3. **Keyword Blocking** 🚫
- Blocks common spam keywords (viagra, casino, crypto scams, etc.)
- Customizable list - add your own spam words

### 4. **Comment Moderation** ✋
- First-time commenters must be approved
- Prevents new spammers from posting immediately
- Trusted commenters (previously approved) can post freely

### 5. **Time Delay Check** ⏱️
- Requires minimum 5 seconds between page load and submission
- Bots submit instantly, humans take time to type
- Blocks automated spam bots

### 6. **Disposable Email Blocking** 📧
- Blocks temporary/throwaway email addresses
- Spammers often use these services
- Includes common disposable email domains

### 7. **Suspicious Pattern Detection** 🔍
- Blocks ALL CAPS comments (70%+ caps = spam)
- Blocks excessive exclamation marks (!!!!!!)
- Identifies typical spam patterns

### 8. **Old Post Protection** 🕒
- Optional: Auto-close comments on posts older than 90 days
- Spammers target old posts
- Currently disabled - uncomment to enable
